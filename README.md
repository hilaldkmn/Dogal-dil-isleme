Natural Language Process

There are two different programs written in Python.

The libraries used on the "web-scraping.py" page are Beautiful Soup Library, NLTK Library, Url.request Library.
The Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. The NLTK is a  platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. The urllib.request module defines functions and classes which help in opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world â€” basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more.

The libraries used on the "word-correction" page are Regular Expression Module, NLTK Library, Collections Module. This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-bit strings. Collections module in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example, list, dict, set, tuple etc. These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data. One such module is the Python collections module.
